Silicon Valley Parody App

Jian-Yang: What if I told you there is an app on the market...

Erlich: No, you wait until you're inside. Okay? We haven't even gotten the bottle of water yet.

This is a parody on HBO's Silicon Valley. It uses a Google Cloud Vision pre-trained image classifier to identify things in food and food dishes itself. It's not meant to be taken seriously.
